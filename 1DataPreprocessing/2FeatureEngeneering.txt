Feature is an attribute or property shared by all of the independent units on which analysis or prediction is to be done.

Feature Engineering is the process to create feature/extract the feature from existing features by domain knowledge to increase the performance of Machine Learning Model.

Why is Feature Engineering Important?
Quality data always help to improve the accuracy and performance of Machine Learning model.
Machine Learning algorithm follow the rule (learn like Kids)
