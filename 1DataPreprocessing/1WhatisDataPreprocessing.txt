Major steps in Data Preprocessing

Data Cleaning
Data Integration
Data Reduction
Data Transformation
Data Discretization

Data Cleaning means fill in missing values, smooth out noise while identifying outliers, and correct inconsistencies in the data.

Data Integration is a technique to merges data from multiple sources into a coherent data store, such as a data warehouse.

Data Reduction is a technique use to reduce the data size by aggregating, eliminating redundant features, or clustering, for instance.

Data Transformation means data are transformed or consolidated into forms appropriate for ML modeltraining, such as normalization, may be applied where data are scaled to fall within a smaller range like 0.0 to 1.0.

Data Discretization technique transforms numeric data by mapping values to interval or concept labels.It can be used to reduce the number of values for a given continuous attribute by dividing the range of the attribute into intervals.
Discretization techniques include -
Binning
Histogram analysis
Cluster analysis
Decision-tree analysis
Correlation analysis
